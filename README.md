*Updated by MajikalExplosions for e1.5.7*\
Download the distribution package from Nexus [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/1151/).
The original code for versions up to 1.4.3 belongs to ukiie. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ukiie/bannerlord-advanced-autoresolve).


Note for modders: To successfully build, change **BannerlordPath** property in **AdvancedAutoResolve.csproj** to your M&B directory. Example: *D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount \&amp; Blade II Bannerlord* (Note that instead of **&**, you should use **\&amp;**).
